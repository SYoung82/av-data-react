This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Av-Data-React
A simple front end for retrieving information from FlightAware's FlightXML 3 API.
Intended to be used alongside of [Av-Data](https://github.com/SYoung82/av-data), a Python/Flask back end
that handles the direct communication with FlightAware.

Note the live demo is limited to 500 api requests/month on FlightAware's end.  This limit may have been reached
and the app will not load data if that is the case.
